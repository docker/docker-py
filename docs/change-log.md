    for the images that were loaded, instead of a log stream.
  * `Container.exec_run` now returns a tuple of (exit_code, output) instead of

    instead of just the image object.
  * `APIClient.export`, `APIClient.get_archive` and `APIClient.get_image` now
    return generators streaming the raw binary data from the server's response.
  * When no tag is provided, `DockerClient.images.pull` now returns a list of
    `Image`s associated to the pulled repository instead of just the `latest`
    image.

[List of PRs / issues for this release](https://github.com/docker/docker-py/issues?q=milestone%3A1.2.0+is%3Aclosed)

### Deprecation warning

* `Client.execute` is being deprecated in favor of the more dev-friendly
  `Client.exec_start` and `Client.exec_create`. **It will be removed in 1.3.0**

### Features

* Added `exec_create`, `exec_start`, `exec_inspect` and `exec_resize` to
  client, accurately mirroring the
  [Exec API](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.18/#exec-create)

  for this pull request)
* Added support for `ipc_mode` in host config.
* Added support for the `log_config` param in host config.
* Added support for the `ulimit` param in host config.
* Added support for container resource limits in `Client.build`.
* When a resource identifier (image or container ID) is passed to a Client
  method, we now check for `None` values to avoid crashing
  (now raises `docker.errors.NullResource`)
* Added tools to parse port ranges inside the new `docker.utils.ports` package.
* Added a `version_info` attribute to the `docker` package.

### Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug in `Client.port` where absence of a certain key in the
  container's JSON would raise an error (now just returns `None`)
* Fixed a bug with the `trunc` parameter in `Client.containers` having no
  effect (moved functionality to the client)
* Several improvements have been made to the `Client.import_image` method.
* Fixed pushing / pulling to
  [v2 registries](https://github.com/docker/distribution)

  would fail

  would break when using Python 3.x
* Fixed a bug where some files in `.dockerignore` weren't being handled

  behavior. This should fix all issues encountered with private registry auth

  properly.
* Bumped `requests` version requirement, which should fix most of the SSL
  issues encountered recently.

# HostConfig object

The Docker Remote API introduced [support for HostConfig in version 1.15](http://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.15/#create-a-container).
This object contains all the parameters you could previously pass to `Client.start`.
*It is highly recommended that users pass the HostConfig in the `host_config`*
*param of `Client.create_container` instead of `Client.start`*

## HostConfig helper

### Client.create_host_config

Creates a HostConfig dictionary to be used with `Client.create_container`.

`binds` allows to bind a directory in the host to the container. See [Using
volumes](volumes.md) for more information.

`port_bindings` exposes container ports to the host.
See [Port bindings](port-bindings.md) for more information.

`lxc_conf` allows to pass LXC configuration options using a dictionary.

`privileged` starts the container in privileged mode.

[Links](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/use/working_with_links_names/) can be
specified with the `links` argument. They can either be specified as a
dictionary mapping name to alias or as a list of `(name, alias)` tuples.

`dns` and `volumes_from` are only available if they are used with version v1.10
of docker remote API. Otherwise they are ignored.

`network_mode` is available since v1.11 and sets the Network mode for the
container ('bridge': creates a new network stack for the container on the
Docker bridge, 'none': no networking for this container, 'container:[name|id]':
reuses another container network stack, 'host': use the host network stack
inside the container or any name that identifies an existing Docker network).

`restart_policy` is available since v1.2.0 and sets the container's *RestartPolicy*
which defines the conditions under which a container should be restarted upon exit.
If no *RestartPolicy* is defined, the container will not be restarted when it exits.
The *RestartPolicy* is specified as a dict. For example, if the container
should always be restarted:
```python
{
    "MaximumRetryCount": 0,
    "Name": "always"
}
```

It is possible to restart the container only on failure as well as limit the number
of restarts. For example:
```python
{
    "MaximumRetryCount": 5,
    "Name": "on-failure"
}
```

`cap_add` and `cap_drop` are available since v1.2.0 and can be used to add or
drop certain capabilities. The user may specify the capabilities as an array
for example:
```python
[
    "SYS_ADMIN",
    "MKNOD"
]
```

[List of PRs / issues for this release](https://github.com/docker/docker-py/issues?q=milestone%3A1.2.0+is%3Aclosed)

### Deprecation warning

* `Client.execute` is being deprecated in favor of the more dev-friendly
  `Client.exec_start` and `Client.exec_create`. **It will be removed in 1.3.0**

### Features

* Added `exec_create`, `exec_start`, `exec_inspect` and `exec_resize` to
  client, accurately mirroring the
  [Exec API](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.18/#exec-create)
* Added `auth_config` param to `Client.pull` (allows to use one-off credentials
  for this pull request)
* Added support for `ipc_mode` in host config.
* Added support for the `log_config` param in host config.
* Added support for the `ulimit` param in host config.
* Added support for container resource limits in `Client.build`.
* When a resource identifier (image or container ID) is passed to a Client
  method, we now check for `None` values to avoid crashing
  (now raises `docker.errors.NullResource`)
* Added tools to parse port ranges inside the new `docker.utils.ports` package.
* Added a `version_info` attribute to the `docker` package.

### Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug in `Client.port` where absence of a certain key in the
  container's JSON would raise an error (now just returns `None`)
* Fixed a bug with the `trunc` parameter in `Client.containers` having no
  effect (moved functionality to the client)
* Several improvements have been made to the `Client.import_image` method.
* Fixed pushing / pulling to
  [v2 registries](https://github.com/docker/distribution)
* Fixed a bug where passing a container dictionary to `Client.commit`
  would fail

### Miscellaneous

* Default API version has been bumped to 1.18 (Docker Engine 1.6.0)
* Several testing coverage improvements
* Docs fixes and improvements

1.1.0
-----

### Features

* Added `dockerfile` param support to `Client.build` (mirrors
  `docker build -f` behavior)
* Added the ability to specify `'auto'` as `version` in `Client.__init__`,
  allowing the constructor to autodetect the daemon's API version.

### Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug where decoding a result stream using the `decode` parameter
  would break when using Python 3.x
* Fixed a bug where some files in `.dockerignore` weren't being handled
  properly
* Fixed `resolve_authconfig` issues by bringing it closer to Docker Engine's
  behavior. This should fix all issues encountered with private registry auth
* Fixed an issue where passwords containing a colon weren't being handled
  properly.
* Bumped `requests` version requirement, which should fix most of the SSL
  issues encountered recently.

### Miscellaneous

* Several integration test improvements.
* Fixed some unclosed resources in unit tests.
* Several docs improvements.

* The `memswap_limit` argument in `Client.create_container` now accepts string
  type values similar to `mem_limit` ('6g', '120000k', etc.)

    * As a result, URLs that don't specify a port are now invalid (similar
    to the official client's behavior)
